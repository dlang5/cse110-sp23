# Programming

I have taken CSE 100 using C++, community college courses with Python and Java, and CSS, HTML, also some database stuff previously , but I never have worked in a team.

Here is one of my past projects:
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout<<"Hello world, this is Dennis";

    return 0;
}

```

# Personal

I like computer science because I can apply it to things I like such as fantasy football or just watching sports in general. I also like to watch movies and walk my two dogs.
